          of the StepAhead Health websites at www.StepAheadhealth.com and the

          well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement. YOU AGREE TO BE
          BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT IF YOU REGISTER
          FOR AN ACCOUNT OR USE THE SITES. It's important that you read this
          Agreement thoroughly before signing. You must immediately stop using
          the Sites if you don't want to be bound by this Agreement. The most
          recent version of this Agreement will always be available on the
          Sites; we may change it from time to time. Once a new Agreement is
          posted, your continued access to the Sites means that you have agreed
          to the new terms.

          the service based on your own medical judgment. The care you request,
          receive, or receive from STEPAHEAD HEALTH through the service does not
          constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment from or from
          STEPAHEAD HEALTH , and you agree that this does not apply to any
          health care providers. Viability Health also makes no guarantee as to
          how long it will take a medical provider to prescribe any service via

          representations about their suitability for use in any particular

          A 'Claim' is defined as any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out
          of or relating in any way to your use of this Sites or the Service;
          this includes, but is not limited to, any purchase made through this
          Sites; and your account, if any. It is mutually agreed that neither
          you nor StepAhead Health will file or participate in any class action
          or private attorney general action regarding any Claim brought by
          anyone else on your behalf or on behalf of anyone else. Additional to
          this, you and StepAhead Health agree to resolve all claims through
          final and binding arbitration at the American Arbitration Association
          and waive any right to a jury trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
          arbitrated in Los Angeles County, California, under the Commercial
          Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer-Related Disputes in effect at the time of the Claim. In the
          absence of a request from either party or the arbitrator, the parties
          will submit their written arguments and evidence to the arbitrator.
          The arbitrator will make a decision based solely on the evidence
          presented in court. A 'Desk Arbitration' is the term for this. An
          arbitration hearing can be held via phone for parties who request it
          within 10 days of the American Arbitration Association acknowledging
          receipt of a claimant's demand for arbitration. The parties will not
          be required to travel to Los Angeles in order to participate in
          arbitration proceedings. Even if the Commercial Arbitration Rules and
          the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes expressly
          permit arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, private
          attorney general, or other action, the arbitrator shall have no
          authority or jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class or
          consolidated action.
        </p>
        <p>
          A self-executing arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal
          Arbitration Act and can be enforced by its terms. Any and all
          challenges to the arbitrability of a claim will be decided by the
          arbitrator. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of
          competent jurisdiction.

          govern and be construed in accordance with the laws in force in
          California and the United States, without giving effect to any
          principles of conflict of law. In the event that any provision of this

          severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity or
          enforceability of any remaining provisions. As a result, no waiver by
          us shall constitute a further or continuing waiver of that or any
          other provision of this Agreement, and our failure to assert a right
          or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
          such right or provision. 'Including' is used in this agreement
